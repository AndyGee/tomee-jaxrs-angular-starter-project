# Apache TomEE JAX-RS Starter Project

What is better than a Maven Archetype?  A repo already setup to go, that's what!

Just fork and start coding with this simple starter project.  Includes:

 - Simple `OrangeBean` JAX-RS service
 - Basic `OrangeBeanTest` using Arquillian and the CXF `WebClient`

Sample code designed to be easy enough to delete and move ahead with your real code, 
but complete enough to copy for real tests.

All org.superbiz code and pom references can be safely deleted and replaced with real
project code.

Use of the CXF WebClient is not mandatory.  One could just as easily use Apache HttpClient
or any other http client code.
